**injection** -<br> **injective** no two different inputs result in same output

$$
f(x_1) \neq f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 \neq x_2​
$$

$$
f(x_1) = f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2​
$$

NOT-injective

$$
f(x_1) \neq f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2​
$$

$$
f(x_1) = f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 \neq x_2​
$$

2.3.2 Surjection Type(onto fn') - "surjection covers entire target set"
every element in target set has pre-image in the domain set

1. ray can be formed by any waves(optical, acoustic, microwave, X-ray, matter wave)

    matter exhibits wave-like behavior. For example, a beam of electrons can be diffracted

   **Snell's law** - relationship between **angles of incidence** and refraction when wave passes through boundary between two different **isotropic media**

$$
   {\dfrac{sinθ 
_1}{sinθ 
_2}}
  = n_2,_1
  = {\frac{n_2}{n_1}}
  = {\frac{v_1}{v_2}}
$$
